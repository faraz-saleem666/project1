<h2>MEET CHARLOTTE</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I'm Charlotte, but you can call me Charlie. Capturing authentic moments is my passion, especially when it comes to your wedding day. I believe that your special day should be all about you and your partner celebrating your unique love story in its purest form.
    
    My journey into photography began organically. I started by bringing cameras to birthday parties and capturing candid moments of my friends. Encouraged by the positive feedback on my photos, I delved deeper into the world of photography. In 2016, I founded Charlotte Jane Photography, initially focusing on family, couples, and wedding photography. However, over time, my focus shifted exclusively to weddings, where I discovered my talent for capturing candid moments.
    
    I have a knack for candid wedding photography, immersing myself in the messy, perfectly uncoordinated action of your day. My goal is to make you, your loved ones, and friends feel completely at ease in front of my camera, allowing me to capture every authentic moment with documentary-style snapshots and a whole lot of tender loving care (TLC).
    
    From heartfelt toasts to joyful tears, infectious giggles to unexpected snorts, and even the wild dance floor antics, I'm there to preserve the organic and authentic moments that will become cherished memories, immortalizing the beginning of your beautiful legacy together alongside with my team.</p>
